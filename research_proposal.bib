It draws on the results of a forty-year empirical study of the population biology of the yellow-bellied marmot near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in the Upper East River Valley in Colorado, USA. The text examines life-history features such as body-size, habitat use, environmental physiology, social dynamics, and kinship. Considerable new data analyses are integrated with material published over a fifty-year period, including extensive natural history observations, providing an essential foundation for integrating social and population processes. Finally, the results of research into the yellow-bellied marmot are related to major ecological and evolutionary theories, especially inclusive fitness and population regulation, making this a valuable resource for students and researchers in animal behavior, behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, ecology and conservation.},

Over 6 springs, and at 16 marmot groups, the date of 1st emergence of males, females, and the group as a whole was recorded. Emergence date of males was a function of the number of males in a group (a metric of reproductive competition) and the date that 50\% of the ground was snow free in the marmot group (a metric of climatic variation). The number of adult males explained no variation in the date that the 1st adult female was detected, or the date by which one-half of the group emerged, but the 1st female was sighted earlier in groups with more females. Thus, to understand climatic effects on the phenology of social species, researchers must consider the potential for reproductive competition as well as climatic factors such as the timing of snow melt.},

There is one published report of yellow-bellied marmot juveniles hibernating together at a subalpine site, and social hibernation was reported at a single high-alpine site. Solitary hibernation is expected in woodchucks because they do not share burrows during summer, but is unexpected in yellow-bellied marmots, a harem-polygynous species where females may share burrows and have extensive home-range overlap with female kin during summer. We documented emergence patterns in 13 matrilines to determine whether adult marmots hibernate socially. We found that adult males hibernated with 1 or more adult females, and mothers hibernated with their offspring. Therefore, we conclude that yellow-bellied marmots hibernate socially. There is, however, no evidence that suggests that yellow-bellied marmots receive social thermoregulatory benefits from social hibernation. Documenting social hibernation required us to quantify patterns of emergence from hibernation. Throughout our subalpine site, emergence appears to be getting earlier; a result consistent with a previous report based on 1 colony site and which suggests the effects of global climate change are affecting hibernation patterns.},

The topical collection has two main goals. First, we briefly describe the history of POLS research and provide a refined definition of POLS that is applicable to various key levels of variation (genetic, individual, population, species). Second, we summarise the main lessons learned from current POLS research included in this topical collection. Based on an assessment of the current state of the theoretical foundations and the empirical support of the POLS hypothesis, we propose (i) conceptual refinements of theory, particularly with respect to the role of ecology in the evolution of (sexual dimorphism in) POLS, and (ii) methodological and statistical approaches to the study of POLS at all major levels of variation. This topical collection further holds (iii) key empirical examples demonstrating how POLS structures may be studied in wild populations of (non)human animals, and (iv) a modelling paper predicting POLS under various ecological conditions. Future POLS research will profit from the development of more explicit theoretical models and stringent empirical tests of model assumptions and predictions, increased focus on how ecology shapes (sex-specific) POLS structures at multiple hierarchical levels, and the usage of appropriate statistical tests and study designs.},

There is a clear lack of general rules regarding the impacts of global warming on biota.

Using long-term surveys, experimental data and published results, we show a significant increase in the proportion of small-sized species and young age classes and a decrease in size-at-age. These results are in accordance with the ecological rules dealing with the temperature--size relationships (i.e., Bergmann's rule, James' rule and Temperature--Size Rule). Our study provides evidence that reduced body size is the third universal ecological response to global warming in aquatic systems besides the shift of species ranges toward higher altitudes and latitudes and the seasonal shifts in life cycle events.},

Understanding the resulting evolutionary dynamics is important for predicting possible negative impacts of environmental change for populations and species. Consequently, knowledge of how climate change affects selection and the genetic variation in important traits is crucial in this context. However, the molecular genetics of relevant traits potentially affected by climate change are currently not well known and quantitative genetic approaches offer a possibility to gain insight into this. The aim of this chapter is to illustrate how quantitative genetic approaches can be used to address these questions in the wild, for example by estimating phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation in relevant traits and also by disentangling genetic and phenotypic trends with the help of breeding values. This chapter provides an overview of current evidence as well as an outlook on possible future directions.},

As with matrix population models (MPMs), time is treated as a discrete variable, but in IPMs, state and environmental variables are continuous and are related to the vital rates via generalised linear models. Vital rates in turn integrate into the population dynamics in a mechanistic way. This chapter provides a brief description of the logic behind IPMs and their construction, and, because they share many of the analyses developed for MPMs, it only emphasises how perturbation analyses can be performed with respect to different model elements. The chapter exemplifies the construction of a simple and a more complex IPM structure with an animal and a plant case study, respectively. Finally, inverse modelling in IPMs is presented, a method that allows population projection when some vital rates are not observed.},

  abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary `traits' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with               Baupl{\"a}ne               so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain               why               they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

All of these may affect body condition in wintering dabbling ducks, which in turn may affect an individual's survival and reproductive success. The aim of this study was to assess whether there have been morphometric changes in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Teal (Anas crecca) over the last 30 years at a major wintering site. Body mass and condition increased from the 1950s--1960s to the 2000s in both species. The increase in body mass amounted to as much as 11.7\%, with no corresponding change in body size. Improved body condition was maintained from early to mid-winter, but then converged with historical values for late winter. Our interpretation is that increasingly benign ambient winter conditions permit ducks to maintain better energetic ``safety margins'' throughout winter, and that converging spring departure values may be related to evolutionary flight energetic optima. The observed changes are consistent with large-scale climate amelioration and local/regional habitat improvement (both anthropogenic).},

  abstract = {Courtship displays are behaviours aimed to facilitate attraction and mating with the opposite sex and are very common across the animal kingdom. Most courtship displays are multimodal, meaning that they are composed of concomitant signals occurring in different sensory modalities. Although courtship often strongly influences reproductive success, the question of why and how males use multimodal courtship to increase their fitness has not yet received much attention. Very little is known about the role of different components of male courtship and their relative importance for females. Indeed, most of the work on courtship displays have focused on effects on female choice, often neglecting other possible roles. Additionally, a number of scientists have recently stressed the importance of considering the complexity of a display and the interactions between its different components in order to grasp all the information contained in those multimodal signals. Unfortunately, these methods have not yet been extensively adapted in courtship studies. The aim of this study was to review what is currently known about the functional significance of courtship displays, particularly about the role of multimodality in the courtship communication context. Emphasis is placed on those cases where a complete picture of the communication system can only be assessed by taking complexity and interaction between different modalities into account.},

  abstract = {Yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventris, are obligate hibernators with a relatively short active season. Animals born earlier in the season have higher chances of fulfilling the energetic requirements to survive the long winter. Therefore, the onset of breeding should have a profound impact on juvenile survival. However, there are different ways to compensate for a late start. Late breeders might allocate more resources to late born offspring, making up for the bad start, or juveniles might show compensatory growth. They are not exclusive hypotheses and both can lead to juveniles entering hibernation with a similar body condition. We used data from a long term study in and around the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado to test these two hypotheses. Animals are individually marked and trapped regularly. We compared mass at weaning, mass at the end of the season, growth rates and survival between animals born earlier and later in the season. We found no evidence of increased maternal input: late breeders had lighter offspring at weaning than early breeders, and late born juveniles did not increase their growth rates. Therefore, late born individuals ended the season with lower body mass, and were thus, less likely to survive the winter. In conclusion, life-history trajectories of juvenile yellow-bellied marmots were determined by maternal allocation, whereas postweaning decisions did not modify their fate.},

We currently know little about the prevalence, and evolutionary and ecological causes and consequences of variation in life history plasticity in the wild. Here we outline an analytical framework, utilizing the reaction norm concept and random regression statistical models, to assess the between-individual variation in life history plasticity that may underlie population level responses to the environment at both phenotypic and genetic levels. We discuss applications of this framework to date in wild vertebrate populations, and illustrate how natural selection and ecological constraint may alter a population's response to the environment through their effects at the individual level. Finally, we present future directions and challenges for research into individual plasticity.},

These present a challenge for empirical work examining some of the assumptions, such as the extent and mechanisms of the costs of growth and reproduction. In addition, there is an obvious need for comparative tests of the models. These tests, properly applied, may be particularly informative because they can deal with multiple independent variables, including ecological variables, and can reveal broad trends against a background of constraints on optima and the rate of evolutionary approach to them.             Life histories are the probabilities of survival and the rates of reproduction at each age in the life-span. Reproduction is costly, so that fertility at all ages cannot simultaneously be maximized by natural selection. Allocation of reproductive effort has evolved in response to the demographic impact of different environments but is constrained by genetic variance and evolutionary history.},

  abstract = {Many traits are phenotypically plastic, i.e. the same genotype expresses different phenotypes depending on the environment. Genotypes and individuals can vary in their response to the environment and this genetic (G {\texttimes} E) and individual (I {\texttimes} E) variation in reaction-norm slopes can have important ecological or evolutionary consequences. Studies on I {\texttimes} E/G {\texttimes} E often fail to show slope variation, potentially due to the choice of the environmental covariate. Identifying the genuine environmental driver of phenotypic plasticity (the cue) is practically impossible and hence only proxies can be used. If the proxy is too weakly correlated with the cue, this may lead researchers to conclude there is little or no (variation in) plasticity, and hence lead to downwardly biased estimates of the potential for plastic responses (or evolutionary change in the slope) in response to environmental change. Alternatively, the environment-specific mean phenotype (ESM) across individuals -- which captures all environmental effects on the phenotype -- as covariate should be less prone to such bias. We showed by simulation -- after verifying the concept analytically -- that using weakly correlated proxies indeed biased estimates of slope variation vis-{\`a}-vis the true cue downward but that ESM as a covariate held up well, even when multiple sources of I {\texttimes} E or an interaction between environments (I {\texttimes} E {\texttimes} E) existed in the data. Analysis of two real datasets revealed that estimated I {\texttimes} E and G {\texttimes} E, respectively, were more sizeable and precise when using ESM as opposed to reasonably informative environmental proxies. We argue that the ESM approach should be adopted by biologists as a yardstick in the study of (variation in) plasticity in the wild and that it may serve as a useful starting point for the search of better environmental proxies and unravelling complex I {\texttimes} E or G {\texttimes} E patterns.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter asks: How can evolutionary potential be measured? The question is deceptively simple: whilst evolutionary potential is typically defined on a per-trait basis, it has become clear that the complex genetic architecture of quantitative traits requires other ways to quantify evolutionary potential and constraints. This chapter reviews knowledge about multivariate evolutionary potential in the wild and the extent to which genetic covariances, as summarized in the G-matrix, impact evolutionary trajectories of natural populations both in terms of rate and direction. In terms of constraints, genetic covariances among traits can slow down the rate of adaptation, and influence the direction of the response to selection. However, the constraints posed by genetic covariances are insurmountable only if G-matrices are stable. The chapter thus reviews firstly theoretical predictions about the stability of G in relation to selection, migration and drift, and secondly methods available to test differentiation among matrices. To date, a majority of studies imply conservatism of G-matrices; however, a couple of recent studies have revealed that differentiation of G-matrices among wild populations can also be very fast, especially during colonisation of new habitats. Furthermore, as an increasing number of methods have been proposed for comparing G-matrices, we assessed how these methods perform under different hypothetical scenarios. The chapter shows that limited statistical power could often lead to erroneous conclusion of matrix conservatism, suggesting caution is needed in interpreting the results of matrix comparisons. The chapter concludes by identifying areas in need of further research.},

  abstract = {Phenotypes vary hierarchically among taxa and populations, among genotypes within populations, among individuals within genotypes, and also within individuals for repeatedly expressed, labile phenotypic traits. This hierarchy produces some fundamental challenges to clearly defining biological phenomena and constructing a consistent explanatory framework. We use a heuristic statistical model to explore two consequences of this hierarchy. First, although the variation existing among individuals within populations has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists, within-individual variation has been much less emphasized. Within-individual variance occurs when labile phenotypes (behaviour, physiology, and sometimes morphology) exhibit phenotypic plasticity or deviate from a norm-of-reaction within the same individual. A statistical partitioning of phenotypic variance leads us to explore an array of ideas about residual within-individual variation. We use this approach to draw attention to additional processes that may influence within-individual phenotypic variance, including interactions among environmental factors, ecological effects on the fitness consequences of plasticity, and various types of adaptive variance. Second, our framework for investigating variation in phenotypic variance reveals that interactions between levels of the hierarchy form the preconditions for the evolution of all types of plasticity, and we extend this idea to the residual level within individuals, where both adaptive plasticity in residuals and canalization-like processes (stability) can evolve. With the statistical tools now available to examine heterogeneous residual variance, an array of novel questions linking phenotype to environment can be usefully addressed.},
