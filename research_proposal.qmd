# Introduction {#sec-intro}

## Climate change

The impacts of climate change on natural environments are well-documented and can, obviously, no longer be ignored [@intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechangeipccClimateChange20222022]. Broadly speaking, climate change encompass melting ice caps, rising sea levels. More specifically, main characteristics of this global change, usually documented, includes: **Raising temperature**; **Changing season lengths**; **Environmental variability and unpredictibility**; **More frequent and severe droughts**; **Incresing frequency and severity of extreme weather events** [@intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechangeipccClimateChange20222022].


Climate change do impact human society, this is, for example, well represented in the city of Ottawa, ON, Canada. Temperature, snowing and raining trends in the Canadian capital over the last century, reveals worrying figures [@walshPrecipitationTemperatureTrends2022], and future projections are not much more reassuring [@zhaiFutureProjectionsTemperature2019]. A concrete consequences of these changes in Ottawa is the management of the Rideau canal ice skating rink. Indeed, in later years the oppening of the world's longest ice staking risk has been more and more uncertain, and its future is unfortunately but, fatally, questionable.

But most of all, climate change seriously impacts the vast majority of Earth's ecosystems, as shown by countless studies [@intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechangeipccClimateChange20222022]. These profound ecological changes are putting a large number of species at risk, and they must act accordingly to avoind etinction, either by dispercing or adapting [@gienappEvolutionaryDynamicsResponse2014]. It is crucial to improve our comprehension of how natural population react to this rapid and unpredictable changes in order to conduct efficient conservation policies.


## Body mass as a Life-History Traits (LHT)

Life history traits (LHT) are phenotypic characteristics that impact directly an individual's survival and reproduction representing its selective value, or "**fitness**" [@Roff1992TheEO].
The concept of life history theory relies on the fact that organisms have limited ressources and must allocate them strategically between competing funtions such as growth, maintenance, and reproduction [@Roff1992TheEO; @10.1093/oso/9780198577416.001.0001].

Various traits can be considered as LHTs, as they represent the outcome of this resource allocation process. Among these, body mass plays a crucial role in many species. Individuals with greater body mass typically have greater energetic resources, making them more resilient to environmental pressures by giving them a greater capacity to buffer poor years in terms of resources (!!!<!-- publication about bet-hedging => max body mass to cope with bad years, looks at moufflon thÃ¨se de Julien -->).

Additionally, individuals with greater energy reserves have a better capacity to reproduce and are often more attractive to potential mates, leading to higher reproductive sucess. In this context, body mass is considered to be an "honest signal" of an individual capacity to accumalte resources and its quality as a reproducer (!!!). Therefore body mass can be considered a key LHT influencing directly both survival and reproduction in many species.

However, as said before, energy quantity are limited and cannot be invested only in body mass. Moreover, a too large body mass can become a handicap [@jebbBiggerNotAlways2021], and even though some handicaps has been theorized to be an asset in sexual selection [@10.1093/oso/9780195100358.001.0001], beyond a certain threshold, too large individuals will be counter-selected against smaller ones. Hence, as predicted in Life History Theory, trade-off must be maid between available energy and individual's performances to find the optimal body mass.


### Link with hibernation

The importance of body mass as a LHT is particularly true for a specific group of species: **Hibernating species**. To survive unfavorable season (usually winter) some species disperse to milder environments, other cope with it and find ways to survive through (!!!). A way found by some species to survive through is to enter a specific state of torpor, called "hibernation". 

This strategy consists of reducing the metabolism to a minimum survival level. More specifically, "Fat-storing" hibernators (in opposition to "Food-storing hibernators") will sustain on their energetic ressources, stocked in their white adipose tissue, through the winter, then emerge at the start of the favourable season (Spring/Summer) [@geiserHibernation2013a; @nedergaardMammalianHibernation1990; @careyMammalianHibernationCellular2003].

A commonly prerequired adaptation for that kind of behaviour is therefore the capacity to stock important quantities of reserve (i.e., large body mass) in order to have sufficient energetic stocks to survive without foraging for a full season.

Furthermore, this energy gathering must be done in a short amont of time, hibernating species are usually active only for a small part of the year, during which they must forage as efficiently as possible to gain enough mass to survive through next hibernating season. Some fat-storing hibernators nearly double their weight during the active season [@careyMammalianHibernationCellular2003; @armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014].

Hence, not only a prerequired adaptation is an important body mass, but also a sufficiently efficient metabolism to gain weight quickly, which represent a lot of challenges and specific adaptation. Body mass and metabolism are therefore highly constrained in hibernating species (!!!).

Additionally, for some species, reproduction occurs right at the onset of the active season, which means that before entering into hibernation, individuals much reach a threshold body mass sufficient not only to survive, but also to have to reproduce directly after. Body mass is therefore a keystone LHT for hibernating species' biodemography.

<!-- {One of the most commonly known example of hibernating species in our society are the Marmots [@armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014]. [...]} (Is it a good strategy to bring the marmots (as a tribe, not the YBM yet) here, knowing that I wont talk about it till the end of the intro?) -->

Meanwhile, Climate change is expected to have significant impact on such LHT. It has been theorized that change in body size could be a third universal response to climate change, alongside modification in phenology and geographic range [@gardnerDecliningBodySize2011; @daufresneGlobalWarmingBenefits2009; @durantClimateMatchMismatch2007; @visserShiftsPhenologyDue2005]


### Expected effect of global warming on body mass

As reminded earlier, one of the most significant consequences of climate change is an increase in global temperature (which is why climate change is also commonly reffered to as *global warming*, although this term is often used in climate sceptics rethoric during unusually intense episodes of cold[^1]<!-- poorly said but find a way to keep it in the proposal -->).

This average temperature increase is suspected to influence phenotypic traits such as body mass or size. However, the direction of the response remains uncertain. Some authors argue that a shrinking body size should be a universal response to climate change [@daufresneGlobalWarmingBenefits2009]. This hypothesis follows Bergmann's rules, which state that smaller body size should be favoured in warmer environment as it raises the surface to volume ratio, thus facilitating heat dissipation [@bergmannRelationshipsHeatConservation1847]. Therefore, in a warmer environment, due to global warming, an adaptive response could indeed be a shrinking body size.

However, as noted by @gardnerDecliningBodySize2011, a lack of large-scale comparative studies prevent us to demonstrate that this response is universal. In addition, in 2022, the IPCC's report stated that "Evidence is weak for a consistent reduction in body size across taxonomic groups in terrestrial animals" [@intergovernmentalpanelonclimatechangeipccClimateChange20222022; @siepielskiNoEvidenceThat2019].

Moreover, several studies at higher latitude yield opposite results [i.e., increasing body mass in response to climate change, @guillemainWinteringFrenchMallard2010; @yom-tovRecentIncreaseBody2008; @sheridanShrinkingBodySize2011; @ozgulCoupledDynamicsBody2010]. At higher latitudes and altitude, climate change is synonym of milder conditions, so individuals have access to a large food supply for a longer time and face less hard conditions during the less favorable season which overall is less energetically demanding. Hence these new, milder, conditions allows individuals to become larger.

## Phenotypic plasticity vs microevolution

Evolution by natural selection was defined by @darwinOriginSpeciesMeans1859 as so: individuals that are best adapted to their environment will have better survival and reproductive sucess. This process result in a population composed mainly of individuals adapted to their environment. So, observed phenotype in natural populations is expected to be the best fit for a specific environment.

However, when this environment changes, as expected with climate change, individuals have two solution to avoid disapearance: **disperse** to a more favorable environment, or **adapt** to their new conditions through phenotypic changes [@gienappEvolutionaryDynamicsResponse2014].

To adapt, there is two further possibilities: **phenotypic plasticity**, defined as a change in phenotype expressed by a given genotype, which allows for a rapid response within an individual lifetime, is highly flexible and does not involve any changes at the genetic level (!!!<!--probably Nussey or maybe Pigliucci, I think there's a book from the late 90' or early 00'-->); and **microevolution**, defined as a change in alleles frequencies in a population over time (!!!<!--needed?-->). When an individual with a better-fitted phenotype for its new environment appears, it would have a better survival and more reproductive success. If this advantage relies on a heritable genetic difference (i.e., transmitted to its descendants, @lynchGeneticsAnalysisQuantitative1998) the new genotype is going to rapidly increase in proportion in the population, ultimately replacing the old one.

Hence, adaptation through microevolution can be slow but is a long-term solution, better fitted for a persistent ecological change. However if the change is transient, plasticity might be better suited. As noted by @dewittCostsLimitsPhenotypic1998 and @gardnerDecliningBodySize2011, phenotypic plasticity solely is unlikely to be the most optimal long-term response to climate change as it is usually a transient answer to a temporary change, presenting costs and limits [@dewittCostsLimitsPhenotypic1998]. Furthermore, if the optimal response to the new environment is a canalized phenotype (i.e., very low phenotypic variance), plasticity can even be maladaptive [@nusseyEvolutionaryEcologyIndividual2007]. Therefore, the expected optimal answer to a long-term environmental change, as those expected with climate change, is evolution through natural selection.

Phenotypic pasticity and microevolution are not expected to be mutually exclusive. This is particularly evident in highly plastic traits such as body mass which can vary significantly up and down throughout an individual's life in response to among- and within-year changes in environmental conditions but can also change via microevolution at the population level over the same time period.

Nevertheless, as the consequences of theses mechanism can be highly different on the long term (evolution being more permanent than plasticity), quantifying the extent to which each of these mechanisms contributes to the observed change over a long study period remains a challenging but fundamental task to understand the adaption and evolution of species.


## Quantitative Genetics and Animal Models

As we have discussed, climate change is expected to cause long-term environmental changes. Thus, natural population will need to adapt to these new conditions in order to persist (!!!<!-- needed?-->). As mentioned earlier these adaptations can involve shift in geographical ranges, phenology, or phenotype [@gardnerDecliningBodySize2011; @daufresneGlobalWarmingBenefits2009; @durantClimateMatchMismatch2007; @visserShiftsPhenologyDue2005]. As climate change imply deep and long-term environmental modification, we expect natural population to **evolve**, allowing them to be better suited to new environments [@sihEvolutionBehaviouralResponses2011; @darwinOriginSpeciesMeans1859].

However, estimating evolutionary signal in natural conditions can be complicated, and an observed phenotypic change is not necessarily due to evolution (i.e., phenotypic plasticity).
Fortunately, quantitative genetic provides us a robust and well-established method to adress this by decomposing the total phenotypic variance ($V_P$) into it's genetic ($V_A$) and environmental ($V_{PE}$) components: $V_P = V_A + V_{PE}$ [@lynchGeneticsAnalysisQuantitative1998; @wilsonEcologistsGuideAnimal2010].

A well-known statistical method to estimate these variance components from observed phenotypic data is the **Animal Models** [@kruukEstimatingGeneticParameters2004]. This method allows a robust estimation of the genetic variance in a trait affected by a large number of genes, each with small effects [i.e., a "quantitative trait", @lynchGeneticsAnalysisQuantitative1998; @kruukStudyQuantitativeGenetics2014]. An Animal model is a specific kind of mixed model using individual identity as a non-independant random effect, linked to a relatedness matrix between each individual, extracted from the population pedigree (i.e., parental links between each individuals in the population population, @lynchGeneticsAnalysisQuantitative1998).

This method has the advantage of being relatively simple to employ, enabling genetic parameters estimation directly from phenotypic data. Only parental links between individuals need to be known, making this method applicable to wild populations [@kruukEstimatingGeneticParameters2004; @lynchGeneticsAnalysisQuantitative1998].

As emphasized by @kruukStudyQuantitativeGenetics2014, there is a pressing need for quantitative genetics studies on long-term wildlife populations, as the most common problem in such studies is the lack of statistical power, which can be resolved thanks to the quantity of data brought by long-term studies. Such studies would improve our understanding of the relationship between animals and their environment, as well as the genotype-phenotype-environment relationship, especially in a context of global change.


### Traits coevolution

A well-recognised challenge when studying evolution in natural context, is to consider the genetic correlation between several traits, causing **traits coevolution** [@gouldSpandrelsSanMarco1979; @Roff1992TheEO]. Indeed a trait cannot evolve independently without impacting other traits. This constraint narrows the range of possibility and reachable outcomes in the adaptive landscape [@arnoldAdaptiveLandscapeConceptual2001; @teplitskyEvolutionaryPotentialConstraints2014; @gouldSpandrelsSanMarco1979].

When studying the evolution of a specific trait (especially ones having important phenotypic consequences), failling to account for its link with other traits is an oversimplification. This misconception can bias not only our understanding of the causes and consequences of phenotypic change, but also the estimations of its evolutionary potential [@teplitskyEvolutionaryPotentialConstraints2014; !!!]. To effectively study traits' evolution, it is essential to consider that selection generally acts on multiple traits simultaneously, as phenotype is the result of a combination of various traits <!-- clarity... -->[@phillipsVISUALIZINGMULTIVARIATESELECTION1989].


A continuation of this reasoning is the extended **Pace Of Life Syndrome** (POLS) suggesting that life-history strategy, physiological and behavioral traits coevolve in response to the environment [@dammhahnPacelifeSyndromesFramework2018; @realePersonalityEmergencePaceoflife2010].

So, if climate change induce LHT modifications, it is to expect that other key physiological or behavioural trait will coevolve with it. For example, it has been observed that certain behvioural types will be consistently associated with certain Life-History strategies [e.g., individual with faster life-cycle will tend to be bolder @stampsGrowthmortalityTradeoffsPersonality2007; @wolfLifehistoryTradeoffsFavour2007; @biroAreAnimalPersonality2008].


As such, changes in LHTs are expected to have even greater impacts on the global phenotype. A robust method to study such changes are **Multivariate Animal models** (i.e., an Animal model with multiple phenotypic traits as dependant variables) which allows us to estimate the genetic covariance between each trait [!!!<!--Kruuk 2004?-->].

However such models are heavily data-consuming, and the main reason that significant results with such methods are quite rare today is that only a few studies have enough data to support the statistical power required for theses complex models. Again, using long-term datasets brings a lot of expectation to adress such limitations [@teplitskyEvolutionaryPotentialConstraints2014].


*TRANSITION*


## Individual variation in their plasticity

As explained above, evolution and plasticity are not mutually exclusive, but even more so, plasticity itself can evolve (!!!).

Plasticity is usually studied using **Reaction Norm framework** (!!!<!--look at DeWitt & Scheiner, 2004; Schlichting & Pigliucci, 1998; West-Eberhard, 2003 from Thibaut's proposal intro-->), i.e., studying the value of a phenotypic trait (e.g., body masse) in response to an environmental proxy (e.g., temperature, precipitation). A plastic response correspond to a different phenotypic value associated to a different environment. In this reasoning, a trait is plastic if the slope of the reaction norm is different from 0 [@nusseyEvolutionaryEcologyIndividual2007].

A reaction norm has two parameters: **Elevation**, which is the expected phenotypic value in the average environment; and the **Slope** corresponding to the linear regression of the phenotype over the environmental gradient. In statistical terms, these parameters correspond respectively to the "Intercept" and the "Slope" of the linear regression of the phenotype over the environment.

This is how phenotypic plasticity is usually studied. however, as emphasized by @nusseyEvolutionaryEcologyIndividual2007, a lot of information is loss when plasticity is only studied at the population level (i.e., fixed linear model of the phenotype over the environment). First using a linear mixed model is crucial to estimate different elevations for each individual, this allows the model to account for the individual variability in their phenotype in the average environment. However, that kind of model doesn't allow to estimate individual-level difference in their plastic response to the environment, which can be biologically significant and must be accounted for.

@nusseyEvolutionaryEcologyIndividual2007 proposed a framework to estimate that individual variance in plasticity, which is now fairly accepted and used: **Random Regression**. Let's go back to the Linear Mixed Models (LMMs), the most classical type of mixed models is to add a random individual term on the intercept to estimate the "individual variance" by allowing the model to fit one intercept per individual, however in this compilation, the slope is the same for each individuals; now, if we add a random term also on the slope, not only the model estimate one intercept per individual, but also one slope (so, one reaction norm) per individual, estimating thus the individual variance in the phenotype expected in the average environment (*elevation*) but also the individual variation in phenotypic variation (*slope*) which is commonly called $\textbf{I * E}$.

Once we've estimated this between-individual variance in plasticity, we can use quantitative genetic methods (i.e., Animal models, but this time using Random Regression Animal Model: "RRAM", @nusseyEvolutionaryEcologyIndividual2007) to decompose this variance into it's genetic and permanent environment part to estimate the genetic variation between-individuals in plasticity, which is usually named $\textbf{G * E}$. From that we can estimate the heritable variation in reaction norm's slope and have an idea of the evolutionary potential of phenotypic plasticity itself.

From a theoritical point of view, this is a good method, satisfying to estimate properly the ${I * E}$ and ${G * E}$. However, as underlyned by @ramakersProbingVariationReaction2023, an important limitation with this method is the environmental proxy used for the reaction norm. Indeed, if this latter isn't good enough (i.e., to far from the real predictor of the plastic response), an important part of this ${I * E}$ is missed (called "hidden ${I * E}$").

Furthermore, it's often impossible to identify the real driver of plasticity in natural conditions (Which is expected as natural environments are exceptionally complex systems, and individuals generally doesn't have only one environmental variable to deal with...), the real driver can be unknown, unmeasurable are a combination of a lot of different variables [@ramakersProbingVariationReaction2023]. In response to that, the authors proposed a new method, using the Environment Specific Mean phenotype (ESM). Although they've shown this method is indeed efficient, they emphasized that we still need a really good knowledge of the studied system, and really specific conditions to be more efficient that the "regular" method. Hence, although it's a progress, more work is needed to deal with this ${I * E}$ detection in natural environment problem.

The good news is that we have a really promising, fairly new statistical method that could be applied to that: the "Double Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model" (DHGLM, !!! *find citation + maybe explain a little the method*) [...] from this method we can estimate the *variance in the residual variance* (i.e., "$\boldsymbol{V_{V_e}}$" by estimating the residual variance attributable to each individual). Knowing what these models does (*When I'll write it*), we're confident that it can be applied to developp a more powerfull method to detect individual variation in plasticity (${I * E}$) in natural systems. Indeed, a $V_{V_e}$ significantly greater than 0 should indicate that there is some ${I * E}$ in the system and would justify investigation by testing different environmental proxies. In contrast, except in very specific conditons, almost impossible in natural conditions (i.e., **perfect** contrary effect), a $V_{V_e}$ equal to 0 indicate that there's no individual variation in plasticity in the studied system. From this method we should be a way to free ourselves from the problems of bad proxies. And obviously, as for the random regreession with the RRAM, we can adapt this method we quantitative genetics to also detect $${G * E}$$ if $${I * E}$$ is detected.

This new method is thus very promising, however, as most new statistical methods, it often poorly understood/used. Hence, a general framework (supervised by someone with good statistical knowledge, i.e., Julien) including the application on how DHGLM could (should) be used to detect ${I * E}$ would be really helpful for the comunity (especially with the rising need to study efficiently phenotypic plasticity and it's evolution, in natural condition with climate change).


Link with body mass, individual can vary in their growing speed <=> Reaction norm/Plasticity change over time => Evolution directly on the plasticity <=> individual answer to the condition change would be increase their response (i.e., body mass increase within the active season). It would make sense with bet-hedging framework for example


### Bet-hedging

Bet-hedging strategy can be summerized as betting on the best fitness for the long term, even though it means lower a bit your immediate fitness, in order to cope with an unpredictable environment [@starrfeltBethedgingaTripleTradeoff2012].

With climate change, environment are less predictable than ever, and the effects of these change are even more important in alpine habitat [@inouyeHIGHALTITUDECLIMATES], which can, in consequence, favour bet-hedging then.
Thus bet-hedging, for example increase you body size to "buffer" is not a crazy strategy, but can be risky in the future => potential phenological mismatch (i.e., [...], @stensethClimateChangingPhenology2002; @visserShiftsPhenologyDue2005), bet-hedging is a bet, so you're not sure to win in the end, and it can end in maladaption...

But, by definition, a "bet" comports risks, and in such variable conditions due to an extremely fast climate change, betting on the future can end in evolutionary traps [@schlaepferEcologicalEvolutionaryTraps2002; @robertsonEcologicalNoveltyEmergence2013]. <!-- whatch out how you say this, there is no intentionality in the "bet"! -->


## Species and study

Since 1962, a wild population of Yellow-Bellied Marmots (*Marmota flaviventris*, "YBM") is followed yearly, first supervised by Kenneth Armitage, and today by Julien Martin and Daniel Blumstein, at the Rocky Moutain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Gothic, Colorado, USA (38Â°56â34â â 38Â°59â13â N / 106Â°58â60â â 107Â°0â45â W), this is the second longest-term study of a natural mammal population in the world.
YBM is a ground-dwelling sciurid (rodentia, sciurideae) inhabiting alpine habitats in western North America with a life cycle divided between an "active season" representing approximately a third of the year (from May to September) where individuals must forage to reach a threshold body mass in order to survive hibernation for the remainder of the time [@armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014].
Individuals experience high seasonal flutuation in body mass, with a critical threshold to be reached before the onset of hibernation in order to 1) survive through the next active season and 2) have sufficient energy left for hibernation [which occurs in the first weeks of the active season, @armitageVernalBehaviourYellowbellied1965; @armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014].
Consequently, body mass is consider being a critical LHT for the marmots.
YBM lives in colonies composed usually by one or more matriline with on adult males, multiple adult females and their offspring [@armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014]. Our population is composed of seven main colonies divided between an "up" and a "down valley" with a elevation difference arround 300m ("up" = 3,000m; "down" = 2,700m) implying some difference in weather [e.g., delayed snowmel and vegetation growth onset, temperature difference up to 2 Â°C, @blumsteinYellowbelliedMarmotsMarmota2004; @armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014] and so delayed emergence up to two weeks in the up-valley [@blumsteinSOCIALEFFECTSEMERGENCE2009; @monclusYellowbelliedMarmotsNot2014].
This two differents condition offers an amazing opportunity to test the impact on environment on several factors while working in natural conditions.

This hibernation (life) cycle is highly environemntally dependant, with the onset and end of the active season believed to be mediated mostly by weather variable such as temperature and snow cover of the region [@armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014]. Thus, body mass is expected to be a keystone phenotypic trait for the marmots. It is therefore crucial to understand how this trait and this species responds to global warming, both for conservaion purposes and to elucidate links between phenotype and environment.


### Long-term study data

The monitored population is distributed over 7 main and 31 smaller colonies, divided between an "up" and a "down" valleys (@fig-map-study-site). Each Spring-Summer (May - September) since 1962, marmots are regularly trapped (between 1 and 20 times per individual, with an average of 4.5) using baited Towahawk live traps ($81 * 25 * 30 cm$) situated near burrow entrances. If the individual is captured for the first time, it is identified by placing a unique numbered ear tag on both ears, and with a nontoxic black Nyzanol dye fur mark for distant identification during behavioral observations. Over $95\%$ of individuals are captured between the first two years of their lives and thus have know year of birth and age, from that each we define four age classes, the **juveniles** between 0 and 1 year old, **yearlings** between 1 and 2 years old, **subadults** between 2 and 3 years old, and **adult** over 3 years old.

 At each capture, individuals are sexed, weighted (initially with a spring scale ($Â± 50 g$) and now with a digital balance ($Â± 10 g$)) measured and DNA samples are taken. Behavioral observations and experiments (running speed and Flight Initiation Distance (FID) (!!!)) are conducted all along the season. More descriptions can be found in @armitageMarmotBiologySociality2014.

**Body mass**:
"Body mass is a highly plastic trait, particularly for a hibernating species that experiences considerable fluctuations in body mass throughout the active season. It is, for obvious reasons, impossible to record all individual body mass at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the body mass of each individual at the same time of the year. Using repeated measures for each individual throughout each yearâs active season, ranging from 1 to 20 with an average of 4.5, a linear mixed model was fitted to predict each individualâs body mass on August 15 each year (for details see Ozgul et al. (2010) and Jebb et al. 2021)."<!-- rewrite, developp, citation (Martin) -->

### Body mass increase in Yellow-Bellied Marmots (YBM)

An important body mass increase has been observed in this population over the past half-century (estimated arround 600 g for the adult females). Precedent studies attributed this major change mostly to phenotypic plasticity [@ozgulCoupledDynamicsBody2010]. This hypothese made in fact a lot of sense, with climate change active season is getting longer (milder condition, higher temperature, less snow, shorter winter, etc.), hence marmots have more time to forage, gain weight, and the hibernation period is getting shorter so less time for the individuals to lose mass, at the end of the day, we have heavier individuals, makes sense!
However, using animal models to properly assess the genetic attributable part of this change, estimating explicitely the body mass' evolutionary signal for the adult females over the time cohort (i.e., year of birth) during the study period, we found an increase, at the genetic scale, estimated arround $400\ g$, with a heritability of $56\%$ (Birot & Martin, Manuscript in progress, @fig-A-F-bodymass). So, in fact, arround two third of the body mass increase seems to be due to evolution, not just plasticity.
Furthermore, although the lengthening active season is indeed a good potential explanation for the body mass increase through phenotypic plasticity, it doesn't match with the observed evolutionary signal. If the main selective pressure on body mass is survival through hibernation (i.e., heavier individuals having more chance to survive through winter as they have more ressources), then the expected evolutionary response (i.e., average body mass increase) is occuring when the pressure is decreasing, which seems counter-intuitive.
There is a pressing need to explore which environmental factors may have triggered this shift, the mechanisms behind this increase, and the potential implications for the population's future to better understand how can natural population cope with climate change.

## Research objectives & Methodology

Since this major phenotypic shift for the YBM in the last half-century has been miss considered, knowing that there is in fact a strong evolutionary signal, we need to reconsider the evolutionary scenario behind this body mass increase.

I will explore which environmental factors could have triggered this shift, but also the mechanism behind this increase and finally the potential implication for the population's future. <!-- DEVELOPP, but not too much as you developp in the "chapters" -->

*Marmot's Biology: What mechanisms are behind the body mass increase?*

As emphasized in the introduction, we know that the body mass has increased in the last half-century, however we still know very few about it. And for starter, we don't know yet what has changed in the marmots in the last decades: do they have a bigger constitution (i.e., are they born bigger, their Intercept in statistical term), or does their growing capacity has increased through time (in statistical term again, this would correspond to their slope)?

Body mass in juvenile was predicted to stay stable as it favour a higher running speed allowing juvenile to escape predators more efficiently during foraging [@jebbBiggerNotAlways2021]. This was one of the main argument to explain why YBM body mass was (before the 70s) stable in adults, the "invisible fraction" explained by @jebbBiggerNotAlways2021.

However, we see that even if the body mass at birth is indeed stable (@fig-juvenile-trend $a)$), the mass at the end of the individuals first season however, shows a pattern found in @fig-A-F-bodymass. Indeed, the body mass at the end of our juveniles' first foraging season has increased by $23\%$ in 23 years (23 cohorts), meaning that between 1977 and 2000, each cohort was $1\%$ heavier than the last one at the end of their first foraging season (@fig-juvenile-trend $b)$). This could be a serious clue to explain the sudden body mass increase observed in adults arround the same period. We can hypothesized that a relax on the juvenile body mass constrained has occured. Now we must find which constraint has change during this specific period of time (@sec-chap3<!-- JULIEN - On dirait que la refÃ©rence ne fonctionne pas ici-->).

Body mass trend over time cohort for females (gold) and males (black) juveniles compared between the beginning (birth weight) and end of their first active season (mass on August 15th).
:::

Increasing (estimated from local regressions):

* **Males**: 1976 - 1998 (22 cohorts) => 1,206.18 g ; 1,519.71 g (+313.53 g)

* **Females**: 1979 - 2001 (22 cohorts) => 1,130.64 g ; 1,363.03 g (+232.39 g)

*However we don't find significant interaction between sex and cohort, meaning that the slight difference in patterns between males and females aren't statistically significant*

As the body mass was previously hypothesized to be stable as an anti-predator strategy, it seems logical to look for a change in predators populations or behaviour between the 1970s and the 2000s at our study site.

# Chapter 2 - Methodology {#sec-chap2}
*Methodology: $I * E$ detection with Double Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (DHGLM)*

[@nusseyEvolutionaryEcologyIndividual2007] --> double random

So we're doing something different --> examining the residuals of the model (if I * E, still a lot of residual variance ?)


**Look at this one: [@westneatBiologyHiddenResidual2015a]


DHGLM, brms, Julien's code

Vve (Variance dans la variance rÃ©siduel, estime la variance rÃ©siduel pour chaque individu et regarde la variance dans cette variance rÃ©siduelle, si I * E Vve > 0)

Attention aux modÃ¨le dÃ©balancÃ©s si pas d'effet fixes
corrige pour les variations par effet fixes, puis test pour le I * E, si y'en a tu pexu chercher la variable environnemental pour lesquels on a de la variation dans la plasitcitÃ© (I * E)

<!-- Okay, so now you know what is the problem about estimating/detecting I * E, you know what is a DHGLM (cause I've explained everything in the intro) now here's what I'm gonna do

Simulations to see how we can estimate it (data with and without I * E => fit the models, check how the different parameters reacts and how we interpret it, and also how we can present them)

Simulation to test the different bias (Sampling bias, etc.) -->

# Expected Products

A list of the (usually 1/3) articles expected for completion of the
MSC/PhD. Think of each as a fantasy abstract.

1.  The Evolution of Human Uniqueness. [Bob Hette & Julien
    Martin.]{.underline}

    There is wide agreement that humans are unique. But it is rarely
    asked: Have they always been unique? In this paper, we derive a
    general uniqueness theorem that states that any unique species must
    have been less unique at some point in the past. This theorem has
    implications for the achievement of world peace.

2.  Niche Construction, Disease Transmission, and Global Warming: Chaos
    Deconstructs the Block Chain. [Bob Hette, Igor Tex & Julien
    Martin]{.underline}

    How many buzz words can be combined in a title? In this paper, we
    find that the natural limit on buzz words in any specific scholarly
    field is always given by the triangular number $T_n$ where $n$ is
    one more than the number of tenured faculty in the field.

3.  A Bayesian Hierarchical Survival Analysis of Counting Sheep. [Bob
    Hette & Julien Martin]{.underline}

    Just like all those other models of counting sheep, but this one
    will be Bayesian.
